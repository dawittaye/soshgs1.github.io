          <h5>SOS <span>HGS</span></h5>
          <p>
            Hermann Gmeiner founded the SOS Children's Villages Hermann Gmeiner Academy in 1981, in order to provide the employees of SOS Children's Villages with a common space for encounters and education.
             The Hermann Gmeiner Academy is a place of intercultural encounter for employees from all over the world across all cultural, religious, political and hierarchical realities.

In warm hospitality, it is also open to the many friends of the SOS Children's 
Villages and other social organizations. The Hermann Gmeiner Academy works on behalf of its association's own board and is a member of the umbrella organization of SOS Children's Villages International.
